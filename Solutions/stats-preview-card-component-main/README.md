## My process

I started out by building the skeletal structure of the HTML and then afterwards I used flexbox to divide each div into its own section, and then after that I used CSS properties to change thing.
I also used the google fonts import option to import the fonts

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use Flexbox to create good margin and padding. Also I learned how to add an overlay

### Continued development

- I need to practice CSS Grids
- I need to be better at Semantics
